# PipeVar

PipeVar is a pathogenic variant prioritization workflow for undiagnosed, rare diseases. It utilizes various tools developed from WGLab and other softwares to call structural variants, singule-nucleotide variants, indels and repeat expansions, and prioritize potential pathogenic variants and existing pathogenic variants as well.

PipeVar is implenmetned in Nextflow, and can be ran using Docker or Singularity. We are in the development of utilizing Conda for running, but for the best consistency, use either Docker or Singularity for running PipeVar.
